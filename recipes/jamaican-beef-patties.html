    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Delicious curry-flavored beef pastries, popular 
        in Jamaica and other Caribbean islands.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
    <h3>Pastry:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shortening</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons margarine</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare pastry: Combine flour, curry powder, and 
            salt in a bowl. Cut in margarine and shortening 
            until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 
            water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough 
            into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll 
            each piece into a 6-inch circle (approximately 
            1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; 
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare filling: Melt margarine in a skillet over 
            medium heat. Saut√© onion until soft and translucent, 
            2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ground beef; season with 
            curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, 
            stirring constantly, until beef is evenly browned, 
            8 to 10 minutes. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. 
            Simmer until liquid is absorbed; remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle. 
            Fold over and press edges together, making a 
            half-circle. Use the back of a fork to seal edges, 
            then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a 
            baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 
            about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
