    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix lime juice, cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, 
            fish sauce, green onions, lemongrass, and chili 
            sauce together in a large bowl until sugar is 
            dissolved. Adjust the flavor, if desired, by 
            adding more sugar and/or fish sauce; set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly 
            oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins 
            to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, 
            about 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read 
            140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer steak to a chopping board and slice into 
            thin strips; add steak and its juices into the bowl 
            with herb mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at 
            least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Place lettuce in a salad bowl; arrange cucumber on 
            top. Add steak and pour all of the herb mixture on 
            top. Scatter cherry tomatoes over salad and garnish 
            with fresh cilantro leaves.</li>
    </ol>
